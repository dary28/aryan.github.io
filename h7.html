<p>It is clear from these ideas that the impedance of networks has a considerable
bearing on power system design and operation. Supply authorities
have a statutory obligation to consumers to maintain voltage levels to within
a few per cent of the declared supply voltage. (In Europe this is now 230 V
(phase to neutral) with a permissible variation of +10 per cent and â€“6 per
</p>
<p>cent.) This can be problematic. First, voltage drops down long transmission
lines have to be minimized by choice of conductor cross-section and
impedance. At the same time, it has to be realized that lines and cables having
conductors of larger cross-section are much more expensive, so economic
design is important. Secondly, the variation of load current throughout the
</p>
<p>24-hour day means that the voltage drop in a network also varies. In order
to support the voltage to consumers during periods of heavy demand and
to reduce it during periods of light loading, network transformers have tapchanging
gear which can automatically vary the transformer turns ratio,
and hence maintain the secondary voltage output according to system load
requirements. It should be understood though that tap changers are designed
to accommodate only a small range of voltage variation and do not compensate
for poor system design.
